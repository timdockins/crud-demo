# crud-demo
A demo of a CRUD screen for a simple business object

## History

2016-08-14 : While all 'in-browser', CRUD functions complete.  No delete confirmation, yet.  Refreshing the page will lose the data.
2016-08-11 : Initial cut showing the READ aspect of a CRUD.  Data is randomly generated from Mockaroo.  Initial modal for new element implemented.  No other functionality at this point.

## Technology
### Build Tools
1. NPM - Node Package Manager to install Grunt, Less, Bower, etc.
2. Bower - Bower to install client-side components
3.  Yeoman - and the h5bp generator

### Client-side components
1. Bootstrap - Twitter's Bootstrap for styling and simple page elements (e.g. Modal)
2. Yeti Bootstrap theme - Good and clean starting place for an overall page feel.
2. DataTables - The powerhouse of the page.  Provides a rich table experience (i.e. sorting, searching, pagination) with an accessible API.
3. Knockout - Handles data-binding between the HTML and the JS
4. Font-Awesome - Superior icon set
